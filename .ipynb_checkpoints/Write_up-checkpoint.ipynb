My data where collected for both two tracks and data contais 3 labs for each track in defualt and reverse  direction and  where augmented and spitted to `X_train,y_train,X_test,y_test`. For avoiding high bias of particular steering angle , the appended images was the all the central angles, non 0.0: flipped center, left camera, filliped left camera, right camera, flipped right camera. this data is not the best as it has low number of 0.0 angles but it produced fully autonomous driving on the road and the loading data in function `def generator(samples, batch_size=32)`. Generator was used to generate batches of data in real-time for optimizing the training process time. The total number of data = 38394 and train data= 10238\n",

    "## Disscussion \n",
    "After many trails the good result generated thanks to many tuning to get the output that represent the road segment. in the following output is a 3 segment for road which left off road , right off road and central road.\n",
    "![alt text][image14]\n",

    "However the following output which 5 segment of the image which I think it considers 5 road segment as shown above the the `conv1` output layer as each color represent 1 segment. \n",
    "![alt text][image13]\n",
    "The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. due to low range of zero angles , the vehicle steers left and right with higher rate. however I think due to final output the vehicle drives it self in both tracks in endless of labs and file `Model_summary` contains the model summary and number of tuned parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The archticture with out data normalisation made the car drive it self on both tracks`not_nor_track1.mp4, not_nor_track2.mp4`, however after normalisation the car drive  itself just on first track`track1.mp4` \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I got EC2 instance has failed the system reachability status check. so this result shouild be trained again as validation loss came up and down. I submit it as I am afraid to not pass."
